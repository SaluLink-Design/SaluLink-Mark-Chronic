# SaluLink Specialist Aid Documentation App

A comprehensive AI-powered application designed to assist medical specialists and their assistant teams in accurately documenting chronic condition cases for compliance with Prescribed Minimum Benefits (PMBs). The app integrates free-text clinical note analysis, ICD-10 code matching, and treatment basket mapping to ensure that claims are fully compliant and complete before submission to a medical scheme.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Clinical Analysis

- **ClinicalBERT Integration**: Advanced natural language processing for clinical note analysis

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Data Sources

The application uses two core datasets:

### 1. CMS Chronic Conditions.csv

Contains the list of PMB chronic conditions and their ICD-10 mappings, including:

- Condition names
- ICD-10 codes
- ICD-10 descriptions

### 2. Discovery treatment-baskets-for-the-pmb-cdl-conditions.csv

Contains diagnostic and ongoing management baskets with:

- Procedure/test descriptions
- Procedure/test codes
- Coverage limits
- Specialist coverage information

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Clinical Note Input

- Large text input for clinical notes
- Support for file uploads
- Example clinical notes provided

### 2. ClinicalBERT Analysis

- AI extraction of medical terms
- Confidence scoring
- Potential condition identification

### 3. Condition Selection

- Review AI-suggested conditions
- Search and filter capabilities
- PMB eligibility confirmation

### 4. PMB Compliance

- Treatment basket loading
- Procedure selection with quantities
- Coverage limit validation

### 5. Evidence Documentation

- File upload and management
- Procedure-evidence mapping
- Documentation requirements

### 6. Claim Export

- Automated claim compilation
- PDF generation
- PMB compliance statement

## Example Workflow: Addison's Disease

1. **Input**: Clinical note describing adrenal insufficiency symptoms
2. **Analysis**: ClinicalBERT extracts "adrenal insufficiency, fatigue, cortisol deficiency"
3. **Matching**: AI identifies Addison's Disease (ICD-10: E27.1)
4. **Confirmation**: Specialist confirms the condition
5. **Treatment Baskets**:
   - **Diagnostic**: U & E (4171), Creatinine (4032), Cortisol level (4499), ACTH stimulation (4523)
   - **Ongoing Management**: U & E (4171), Creatinine (4032)
6. **Evidence**: Upload blood chemistry reports, cortisol assays
7. **Export**: Generate compliant claim package
